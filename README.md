# KMeans Clustering

This project demonstrates the application of **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group data points into meaningful clusters. The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `dataset.tsv`.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To perform clustering on the given dataset using the K-Means algorithm and analyze the results.  
- **Dataset**: `dataset.tsv`  
- **Approach**:  
  - Load and preprocess the dataset.  
  - Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm.  
  - Evaluate clustering performance using metrics such as inertia and silhouette score.  
  - Visualize the clusters for better understanding.
